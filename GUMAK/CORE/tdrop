usage: tdrop [options] <program> [program options ...]
                       or 'current'
                       or one of 'auto_show'/'auto_hide'/'toggle_auto_hide'
                       or 'hide_all'
                       or 'foreach'
options:
	-h height	specify a height for a newly created term (default: 45%)
	-w width	specify a width for a newly created term (default: 100%)
	-x pos		specify x offset for a newly created term (default: 0)
	-y pos		specify y offset for a newly created term (default: 1, see man)
	-s name		name for tmux/tmuxinator/tmuxifier/tmuxp session (supported
			terminal required)
	-n num		num or extra text; only needed if for the purpose of using
			multiple dropdowns of same program
	-c cmd		provide a pre-create command
	-C cmd		provide a post-create command
	-l cmd		provide a command to float the window before it is mapped
	-L cmd		provide a command to float the window after it is mapped
	-p cmd		provide a pre-map command
	-P cmd		provide a post-map command
	-u cmd		provide a pre-unmap command
	-U cmd		provide a post-unmap command
	-d XxY		give decoration/border size to accurately restore window
			position; only applicable with auto_show
	-S		can be used to fix saved geometry with auto_hide; see manpage
	-i cmd		provide a command to detect whether the current window is a
			floating window; on applicable with auto_hide
	-f flags	specify flags/options to be used when creating the term or
			window (e.g. -f '--title mytitle'; default: none).
			NOTE: This flag is deprecated. Specify flags after the program name
			instead. This flag may be removed in the future.
			Caution: if there is a tmux session specified (with -s), the option
			to execute a program (usually -e for terminal programs) is
			implicitly added by tdrop
	-a		automatically detect window manager and set relevant options
			(e.g. this makes specifying -l/-L, -d, and -i unnecessary
			for supported WMs) (default: false)
	-m		for use with multiple monitors and only with dropdowns
			(i.e. not for auto_show or auto_hide); convert percentages used
			for width or height to values relative to the size of the
			current monitor and force resizing of the dropdown when
			the monitor changes (default: false)
	-t		use mouse pointer location for detecting which monitor is the current
			one
	-A		always show/activate the window if it is not focused
	-r		save geometry when hiding, restore geometry when showing
	-N		same as -x '' -y '' -w '' -h '' (do not use with those options)
	--wm		set the window manager name to mimic another window manager
			(for use with -a)
	--class name	manually specify the class of the window (can be obtained with xprop)
	--name name	set a new name for the dropdown window
	--clear		clear saved window id; useful after accidentally make a
			window a dropdown (e.g. '$ tdrop --clear current')
	--no-cancel	don't cancel auto-showing (default is to prevent this when
			manually toggling a window after it is auto-hidden)
	--timeout	set the timeout (in seconds) that tdrop will wait for a window
			to appear before giving up in case the program fails to start
			(default: 10)
	--debug		print debugging information to /tmp/tdrop_<user>/log
	--help		print help

See man page for more options and details.
